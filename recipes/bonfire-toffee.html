        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>oil, for greasing</li>
            <li>450g dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>125ml hot water</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cream of tartar</li>
            <li>115g black treacle</li>
            <li>125g golden syrup</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Line the base and sides of an A4 sized tin with non-stick parchment and then grease it really well.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Put the sugar and hot water in a heavy bottomed pan and heat gently until the sugar is dissolved, do not stir the mixture at any point instead tilt the pan if you need to move it around.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Weigh out your remaining ingredients, if you put them in a really well greased jug they will be much easier to pour out. Once the sugar has dissolved add all the ingredients and pop the sugar thermometer in, you can use the thermometer to give it a quick swirl but try not to mix it too much.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>Bring to the boil and boil until you reach soft crack on your thermometer (270/140C) This may take up to 30 minutes, be patient and do not leave the pan unattended as it can change quickly. As soon as it reaches the temp, tip it into your tin and leave it to cool.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Once cool remove it from the tin a break up with a toffee hammer or rolling pin. Store in an airtight tin or wrap up in boxes or cellophane bags to give as gift.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
